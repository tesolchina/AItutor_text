# Quick Railway Deployment - ByteWise Frontend

Hey Bob! ðŸ‘‹

I've set up all the Railway deployment configuration files for you. Here's what I added to fix the deployment issues:

## âœ… What's Been Fixed:

1. **`railway.toml`** - Railway-specific config with health checks
2. **`.env.production`** - Production environment variables
3. **`package.json`** - Added `serve` dependency and Railway scripts
4. **`base_url.js`** - Made API URL environment-aware
5. **`RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Complete deployment guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Deploy Steps:

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done)
2. **Railway Dashboard**: Create new project from GitHub repo
3. **Set Environment Variables** in Railway:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   VITE_APP_DOMAIN=https://avatartutor.hkbu.tech
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://new-bytewise-backend-production-8c33.up.railway.app/api
   ```
4. **Add Custom Domain**: `avatartutor.hkbu.tech` in Railway settings
5. **Update DNS**: Add CNAME record in Alibaba Cloud pointing to Railway

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Changes Made:

- **Fixed Static Hosting**: Added `serve` package for proper static file serving
- **Environment Config**: API URL now adapts to production/development
- **Railway Integration**: Proper build and start commands
- **Health Checks**: Railway can properly monitor the app health

The app should now deploy successfully to Railway and be accessible at https://avatartutor.hkbu.tech/ once DNS propagates.

Check `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` for the complete step-by-step guide!
