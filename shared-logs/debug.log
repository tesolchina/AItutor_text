[2025-09-03 Debug Log - COMPLETED]

Issue Investigation and Solution Implementation:

1. Current Status:
   - Branch: main (merged from fix/conversational-memory)
   - Issue: RESOLVED - Conversation context loss during topic discussion
   - Solution: Context embedding in message content and system prompt

2. Previous Test Results:
   Test Case 1 (07:40:54):
   - Topic: "AI will replace language teachers"
   - Failed: Lost context after topic input
   
   Test Case 2 (07:45:39):
   - Topic: "climate change is a hoax"
   - Failed: Same context loss issue
   
   Test Case 3 (07:59:58) - After Initial Implementation:
   - Topic: "climate change is a hoax"
   - Failed: Still losing context despite state management
   - Issue: "It looks like you've shared a very brief statement" response shows context loss

3. Final Solution Implementation:
   a) Client-side state tracking:
      - Tracking conversation mode: welcome, menu, brainstorm, review, feedback
      - Storing topic and conversation step for context continuity
      - Maintaining state history for error recovery
   
   b) Message content augmentation:
      - Adding explicit context markers in user messages
      - Format: `[CONTINUING BRAINSTORMING ON TOPIC: "topic"] user message`
      - Ensures context persistence even with stateless API
   
   c) System prompt enhancement:
      - Injecting conversation context directly into system prompt
      - Adding explicit instructions about the current topic
      - Preventing repeated topic requests
   
   d) API integration:
      - Using direct URL to smartlessons-production.up.railway.app
      - Removed dependency on environment variables
      - Simplified deployment process

4. Final Testing (13:45:22):
   Test Case 4:
   - Topic: "The future of remote work"
   - Context retention: ✅ Bot remembers topic throughout conversation
   - Follow-up questions: ✅ Bot correctly contextualizes follow-up responses
   - Topic transitions: ✅ Bot handles changes in conversation flow appropriately
   
   Test Case 5:
   - Topic: "Effects of social media on mental health"
   - Context retention: ✅ Bot maintains discussion context
   - Complex exchanges: ✅ Bot builds on previous responses without repeating topic questions
   - Error handling: ✅ Gracefully recovers from ambiguous inputs

5. Key Insights:
   - LLM-based APIs often require explicit context in message content
   - Embedding context in both system prompt and messages provides redundancy
   - Client-side state management is critical for stateless APIs
   - Message augmentation is more reliable than separate context parameters

[SOLUTION DEPLOYED]
The conversation memory issue has been successfully resolved and the fix has been deployed to both the fix/conversational-memory branch and the main branch. The application now maintains context throughout brainstorming sessions and other conversation modes.

Git Operations:
1. Successfully resolved merge conflicts
2. Completed rebase onto deb4828
3. Force pushed to fix/conversational-memory branch
4. Fast-forward merged into main branch
5. Pushed changes to main branch

The solution is now live in production and has been tested with real user conversations.


[2025-09-03 Markdown & Connect Button Debug Log]

Issue: After adding markdown rendering and widening the chat area, the Connect button and all UI event handlers stopped working.

Symptoms:
- Connect button did not trigger any notification or debug log.
- No visible errors in the UI, but no connection was possible.
- Other UI actions (e.g., Clear) also failed.

Investigation:
- Confirmed that the Connect button was enabled and the function was present.
- Added debug logs and notifications to the start of connectAPI, but nothing appeared.
- Checked the browser console for errors; found none directly related to the button.
- Compared recent changes: markdown rendering, chat width, and template edits.

Root Cause:
- A stray <div> tag was accidentally left in the chat message rendering template, breaking Vue's template parsing and event system.
- This caused all event handlers in the component to silently fail.

Fix:
- Removed the extra <div> so the chat message container is valid Vue template syntax.
- Reloaded the app; Connect button and all UI actions now work as expected.
- Markdown rendering and chat width improvements remain functional.

Lesson:
- Even a single template syntax error in Vue can break all reactivity and event handling in a component, with no clear error in the UI.
- Always check for stray tags or invalid template structure after large template edits.

Status: FIXED and merged to main.
