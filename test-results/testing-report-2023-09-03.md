# Conversation Context Testing Report
Date: 2023-09-03

## Issue Summary
The chatbot was losing conversation context after a user entered a topic for brainstorming. Specifically, the bot would ask for a topic, receive it, but then immediately ask for a topic again instead of proceeding with brainstorming ideas about the provided topic.

## Implementation Details

### Approach
1. Added conversation state tracking to maintain memory of:
   - Current mode (welcome, menu, brainstorm, review, feedback)
   - Current step (initial, topic_selection, brainstorming)
   - Current topic (when applicable)

2. Enhanced system prompt with context information:
   ```js
   augmentedSystemPrompt = `${systemPrompt.value}\n\nIMPORTANT CONTEXT: The user has selected to brainstorm about the topic "${conversationState.value.topic}". This is already established, so continue directly with brainstorming ideas about this topic. DO NOT ask them what topic they want to work on again.`;
   ```

3. Added context to user messages during brainstorming:
   ```js
   messageToSend = `[CONTINUING BRAINSTORMING ON TOPIC: "${conversationState.value.topic}"] ${message}`;
   ```

4. Added conversation context to API payload:
   ```js
   conversationContext: {
     mode: conversationState.value.mode,
     step: conversationState.value.step,
     topic: conversationState.value.topic
   }
   ```

### Testing Results

#### Test Case 1: Basic Conversation Flow
- Selected "Brainstorm" (Option 1)
- Entered topic: "Sustainable urban development"
- Bot Response: ✅ Successfully proceeded with brainstorming ideas without asking for topic again
- Follow-up questions: Asked for more specific ideas about green buildings
- Bot Response: ✅ Maintained topic context and provided relevant ideas

#### Test Case 2: Complex Topic with Follow-up
- Selected "Brainstorm" (Option 1)
- Entered topic: "The impact of artificial intelligence on future job markets"
- Bot Response: ✅ Provided initial brainstorming ideas about AI and job markets
- Follow-up: Asked about specific sectors most at risk
- Bot Response: ✅ Correctly contextualized response within the original topic

#### Test Case 3: Topic Switch Testing
- Started with topic: "Climate change solutions"
- After several exchanges, typed "menu" to return to main menu
- Selected new option: "Brainstorm" (Option 1)
- Entered new topic: "Digital privacy"
- Bot Response: ✅ Correctly switched context to the new topic without confusion

## Conclusions

The implementation successfully addresses the conversation context issue by:

1. Explicitly tracking conversation state on the client side
2. Embedding context directly in the system prompt
3. Adding context markers to user messages when needed
4. Providing a context object in the API payload

A key learning from this fix was that LLM APIs sometimes require explicit context in prompt content rather than relying on separate metadata or context objects. By embedding context directly in the prompt text and user messages, we ensure the model maintains appropriate conversation flow.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor for any regression in other conversation flows
2. Consider implementing a more robust state machine for complex conversation paths
3. Explore options for persisting conversation context between sessions
